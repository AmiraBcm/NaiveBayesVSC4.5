# NaiveBayesVSC4.5
"ALPA" an application to classify and exploit dataset using the Naive Bayes and C4.5 algorithms 
***********************************************************************************************************************************
The ALPA API is dedicated to the exploitation and the classification of digital data. it is developed in java and mainly uses the WEKA library which exploits the classification task of Data Mining.
With arff and csv formats, ALPA classifies data using the two famous classifiers of Machine Learning: Naive bayes and C4.5 and possibly allows to analyze, modify and visualize the data in the form of different graphs.
Moreover, being the fruit of a project of end-study, this API makes it possible to implement an approach based on the functionalities of flow and which performs a selection of features by local search using the two algorithms discussed.
For more information about the proposed approach please contact the email address: amirabcm12@gmail.com.
You will find more information about using the application in the application help menu.
