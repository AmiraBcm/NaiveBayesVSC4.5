Welcome to our graduation application ALPA “Academic Licence Project Application”!

 With this application you can analyze and modify your data, classify it by using Machine Learning classifiers (Naïve Bayes and the C4.5) as well as visualizing it in different graphs.
 The application is presented as follow:
	1.	Menu Bar
	2.	Preprocess tab
	3.	Classify tab
	4.	Visualize tab
 The menu bar includes three menus:
	1.1.	File menu:  which contains three items:
		1.1.1.	Open (ctrl +O): for opening .arff and .csv  files.
		1.1.2.	Save (ctrl +S):  for saving files after modifications.
		1.1.3.	Exit (ctrl +E): to leave the application.
	1.2.	Edit menu: This menu allows you to modify the information contained in your data file. It contains three items:
		1.2.1.	Rename (ctrl +R): to change the relation name or the attribute names. To confirm click on OK.
		1.2.2.	Delete (ctrl +D): to delete attributes or instances. Down below are the instructions to follow in order to:
			a.	delete an attribute :
			i.	Click on the “Delete attribute “ button (on the left).
			ii.	Choose the attribute you want to remove.
			iii.	Click the “OK” button to confirm, or exit the delete frame on the contrast.
			The removal operation can always be canceled by clicking on the “Cancel” button of the Edit frame. 
			b.	delete an instance :
			i.	Select the desired instance from the table of instances of the Edit frame.
			ii.	Click on the “Delete instance” button.
			iii.	Confirm by clicking on the “OK” button, or the “Cancel” button in case you want to cancel the operation.

		1.2.3.	 Add (ctrl +A): to add any instances you desire. To add an instance follow the coming instructions: 
			i.	Click on the “Add instance” button (on the left).
			ii.	Modify the values of the new instance (this one will be placed at the end).
			PS: You should take in consideration in case of a numeric attribute, entering alphabetic characters isn’t allowed and in that case it will automatically be changed by 0.
			iii.	Validate the created instance by clicking on the “Validate” button (on the left).
					  However you can cancel all the instances added by clicking on the” Cancel” button.	
		1.2.4.	View (ctrl +V): this last item visualizes the opened file, by displaying the relation name, the attributes names and the different instances.
    1.3 Help menu: which displays this current text.
	
 After the menu bar comes the three following tabs:
	1 Preprocess tab:
	This tab contains all the statics about the opened file and it is presented in three different panels:
		1.1	The “Current Relation” panel: shows the relation name, the number of attributes (including the target attribute), the number of instances and its sum of weight.
		1.2	The “Attributes list” panel: lists the attributes and indicates the class attribute.
		1.3	The “Selected Attribute” panel: is divided into two parts.
		Once an attribute is selected, the first part shows its name, its type (numeric or nominal), and three statistics: missing, distinct and unique which represent respectively the number of the missing, distinct and unique values of the attribute in the data set.
		The second part depends on the type of the attribute; it shows the attributes value table in case of a nominal attribute(label, count and Weight) and the statistical information table in case of a numeric attribute(the minimum value, the maximum value, the mean and the standard deviation of the attribute values).
	
	2 Classify tab:
	This tab allows you to classify the open file’s data; it is divided into two parts:
	The first one concerns the classification criteria and the second part, the results obtained from the classification.
	The first part of the “Classify” tab contains four panels:
		2.1	 The “Test option” panel: this panel contains two testing methods: the cross validation and the percentage split and two text fields to specify the number of the folds and the percentage for them respectively.
		2.2	 The “Attributes Selection” panel : this panel allows you to select a set of attributes that reaches a higher classification accuracy comparing to the initial attributes set(the complete set) .
		2.3	 The “Classifier” panel:  this panel allows you to choose a classifier among Naïve Bayes and C4.5, or to compare their performances by choosing (Naive Bayes VS C4.5).
		2.4	   The “Class Attribute” panel: this panel allows you to specify the target attribute (class label).
	And finally the “Start” button to start the classification.
	
	The results including: the model built, the evaluation measures, the time taken to classify data  and many other details are displayed on the text area.
	In order to classify your data, these are the steps to follow:
		(1)	Choose the testing method (cross validation or percentage split).
		(2)	If you want to make a selection on the attributes set, you should choose one    of the two given   classifiers (naïve bayes or c4.5).
			PS: the selection algorithm uses a classifier as well as the information of the test options section, that’s why both classifiers are given for the selection task.
			Click on the “Launch” button to start the process. The text area shows the results obtained (the remaining /removed attributes, the time taken...etc).
			Once the selection is done, the button “Save as file” allows you to save a file preserving the relation name of the opened file, the selected attributes and the instances (keeping only the values of the selected attributes and the target one). 

			If you do not want a selection on the attributes set, choose the “None” option.

		(3)	Choose a classifier from the “Classifier” panel in order to classify your data.
		(4)	Click on the “Start” button to start the classification.
		
	The results will be displayed on the text area.
	
	3 Visualize tab:
	This last tab displays the open file’s data in graphs for a better analysis. The Visualize tab is organized in three panels:
	3.1	The “Axis variants” panel: it contains two combo boxes to select  x-axis and y-axis values as well as it contains the “Update” button.
	3.2	The “Graphics” panel: it contains all the possible graphical representations 
	(Histogram : for a numeric domain; i.e  x-axis, Bar Chart: for a nominal domain, and Pie chart: for the same nominal attribute selected as a domain and a range).
	3.3	And finally, the last panel that displays the selected graph.
	To display a certain graph follow these steps:
	i.	Choose from the “Axis variants” panel the domain and range of your graph.
	ii.	Select the graphic form from the “Graphics” panel.
	iii.	Click on the “Display” button and watch your graph being displayed on the main panel.
	Things to take in consideration:
	•	Once the domain and range are specified, only the possible corresponding graphs are enabled.
	•	In case of a numeric domain and a nominal range, an interval table will be displayed on a frame as an addition to give each number on the graph’s domain its corresponding interval with its value.
	•	The icon button in the “Graphs” panel allows you to display your graph on an independent frame.
	•	After modifying your data(Edit->{Delete,Add}), you must click on the “Update” button in the “Axis variants” panel to update the information represented in your graph.
